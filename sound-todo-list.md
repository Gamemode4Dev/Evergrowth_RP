### need change
reset button activating
reset button activation failing (fizzle)
reset button charging (there are separate charge sounds, which can be done by changing the pitch)

view/push button swapping (a switch sort of sound)

block sliding over ice (this can take 0.2 or 0.8 seconds, different variation for each that loops)

lamp turning on (a sort of quick buzz of a lightbulb)

magnet pull / push sounds

### are fine, but could use a change
conveyor (needs to loop every 0.8 seconds, should also work nicely with the elevator sound)

block landing on the ground
falling block being caught by a chain
block being pushed (takes about 0.2 seconds)

piston blocked from extending

### are good as is
door closing (takes about 0.2 seconds)
door opening (takes about 0.8 seconds)

button pressing down (takes 0.4 seconds)
button going up (takes 0.4 seconds)

teleporter teleporting (takes 0.5 seconds, could be separate sounds for entrance / exit)

battery 'turning on' with electric crackle
