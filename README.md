# Evergrowth
This document will be going over the following things:

- Resource Pack Minecraft version
- Translating into different languages


## Minecraft Version:
This resource pack is made for version 1.20.2-1.20.4 Future versions may work but lower ones are not suggested to use unless the map specifies otherwise.


## Translation
This map is translatable through the use of translation tags. 
If you want to translate the map to any language of choise the steps are as follows:

- Get in touch with the developers to make sure no one else is already, or has already translated the map into your language.
- find the en_us.json file in assets/minecraft/lang.
- copy paste its components into the right json file for your language and translate all the english text that you want to change.
- Make sure not to translate names such as "Evergrowth", "Gamemode 4", Song names or Character names unless specifically necessary for your language to be readable.
- The top two lines are for translation credits. If you wish for your name to be shown in the lobby of the map for translation credits translate the following segment into your language and replace line two and three with: 
  "gm4_pb.translation.1":"Translation to <language> by",
  "gm4_pb.translation.2":"<names>",
- If you don't want to have your name show up at the start of the map leave the quotations empty, the same as in the english translation.
- For further questions please contact any one of the developers through the gamemode 4 discord at gm4.co/discord and/or check the zh_ch.json file for reference.
- When the translation is finished send it over, through DMs on discord, to a developer and we'll implement it in the next update. And your name should be added to the website for translation credits as well.
- Translations can be done and credited to several people per language
